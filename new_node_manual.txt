for a new sensor connection, go to the company's website and follow their manual

for example:

ouster - https://github.com/ouster-lidar/ouster-sdk
ZED2i - https://github.com/stereolabs/zed-sdk

for a new node to do everything you want do the following (based on the udemy course ROS2 for begginers - https://www.udemy.com/course/ros2-for-beginners/learn/lecture/21805806?start=45:


add a new package (each package can have many nodes but most of the time just one):
1. cd ros2_ws/src
2. write: ros2 pkg create name_of_pkg --build-type ament_python --dependencies rclpy
3. cd ros2_ws
4. write colcon build

add the node:
1. cd ros2_ws/src/name_of_pkg/name_of_pkg
2. create the node - a python file - write: touch node_name.py
3. write the node as you wish - you should follow the guidelines in the udemy course - https://www.udemy.com/course/ros2-for-beginners/learn/lecture/21305288#overview
4. install the node to ros2 - in the name_of_pkg/name_of_pkg dir enter file called setup.py
5. under entry_points insert under console_scripts the name of the desired node like that: "node_name = name_of_pkg.node_name.py:main"
6. cd ros2_ws
7. write: colcon_build
