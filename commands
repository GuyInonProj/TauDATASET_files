!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!dont forgat to do conda deactivate!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

open terminal go to ros2_ws and write : 
ros2 launch ouster_ros record.launch.xml  sensor_hostname:="os-122214001580.local" lidar_mode:=1024x10
for lidar init 
then open another terminal go to ros2_ws and set : 
ros2 run NN_node lidar_segmentation_node
to start Polarnet node 
then open another terminal go to ros2_ws and set : 
ros2 run my_ouster_package my_subscriber 
to start filter the lidar data and published raw data 
now this is what is going on in system lidar init node --lidar data--> my_sybscriber_node --filer x,y,z,intensity from lidar data --> NN_node --process it input to neural net output labeled data -->
if you want to save and debug and get the data to files open another terminal go to ros2_ws and do 
ros2 run slam_data slam_data_node /home/eeproj1/dataset/sequences/11/velodyne/ /home/eeproj1/labels/sequences/11/predictions/
this node process the lidar raw data and corresponds lables and save them in .bin and .lable file for debug you can debug by going to cd /home/eeproj1/semantic-api/semantic-kitti-api
and write  python visualize.py --sequence 11 --dataset /home/eeproj1/dataset --predictions /home/eeproj1/labels/
of course the dirs and sequence name are flexable and need to change if you save it in another place but this api is set to semantick kitti so it need to be in it's dir format meaning after /home/eeproj1/dataset or labels this can be anyting but after it must come sequences-> <some num> -> velodyne for raw data and sequences-><some num > predictions for label data 

temp check i removed this in lunch.xml file of ros ouster node at the end : 
 <executable if="$(var _use_bag_file_name)" output="screen"
    cmd="ros2 bag record --output $(var bag_file)
      /$(var ouster_ns)/imu_packets
      /$(var ouster_ns)/lidar_packets
      /$(var ouster_ns)/metadata"/>

  <executable unless="$(var _use_bag_file_name)" output="screen"
    cmd="ros2 bag record
      /$(var ouster_ns)/imu_packets
      /$(var ouster_ns)/lidar_packets
      /$(var ouster_ns)/metadata"/>
if there are problems added again to line 117 




to run lidar with saved labels debug : 
./run_lidar.sh --debug /home/eeproj1/dataset/sequences/11/velodyne /home/eeproj1/labels/sequences/11/predictions
